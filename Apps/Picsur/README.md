**Official Docs:** [https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur](https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur)

**WebUI Port:** `8282`

**Description from developer:**

> Totally not an Imgur clone. I couldn't really find any open source project that allowed you to easily host images. So I decided to create one. It feels like a hybrid between Imgur and Pastebin.
